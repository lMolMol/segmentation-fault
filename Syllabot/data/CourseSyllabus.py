Course Descriptions 
U of M Course Description: Background and rationale to view Computer Science in a professional context. 
Examination of professional ethics, intellectual property, and privacy considerations important to Computer 
Scientists. May not be held with the former COMP 3620. This course is restricted to students in a Computer Science 
Major, Honours, or Joint Honours program. Prerequisite: 6 credit hours of COMP courses at the 3000 or 4000 level. 
General Description: This course will 1) facilitate the development of professional skills, including group work skills; 2) 
introduce key critical thinking tools, including socio-technical concepts (STC), and 3) apply these skills, tools, and 
concepts to evaluate the role of the computer scientist related to privacy, professional roles and responsibilities, and 
intellectual property; 4) evaluate and assess current issues related to Computer Science.  
Course Learning Objectives 
At the end of the course this term, students should be able to: 
1. Work confidently and capably within a group. 
2. Apply critical thinking strategies to social issues. 
3. Describe the relationship between technology and society as a social-technical system, where society and 
technology co-shape each other.  
4. Critically evaluate social-technical concepts in Computer Science and related technologies.  
5. Describe Privacy, including its history and key aspects in the computer-science socio-technical system 
(e.g., social media). 
6. Describe Professional Ethics, including its history and key aspects in the computer-science socio-technical 
system (e.g., Bias and Politics in Algorithms).  
7. Describe Intellectual Property, including its history and key aspects in the computer-science socio
technical system (e.g., Artificial Intelligence).  
8. Critically evaluate, describe, and analyze case studies related to course topics.

9. Improve professional development skills, including career decision-making and job searching skills.  
10. List professional organizations related to the field of Computer Science.  
11. Improve awareness of the larger social context—both current and historical—of computer science.  
Traditional Territories Acknowledgment 
Th The University of Manitoba campuses are located on original lands of Anishinaabeg, Ininiwak, Anisininewuk, 
Dakota Oyate and Dene, and on the National Homeland of the Red River Métis.We respect the Treaties that were 
made on these territories, we acknowledge the harms and mistakes of the past, and we dedicate ourselves to move 
forward in partnership with Indigenous communities in a spirit of reconciliation and collaboration. 
In COMP 4620, you have the uncommon opportunity in your journey to completing your degree requirements in 
Computer Science to reflect on your role as a computing professional in society. We will discuss different events, 
factors and topics which will allow you to consider how you can contribute, even a little bit, to improving the tech 
world according to values that matter to you; be they equity, justice, truth, professionalism, collaboration, 
representation, fair recognition, and so on. This includes considering the (often disproportionate) impacts 
technology has on Indigenous communities, often without their participation in developing said technology. 
Equity and Inclusion Commitment 
The UofM has a diverse student and faculty population. In this class, we expect everyone to treat each other with 
respect, no matter their identity or beliefs. All of us are constantly learning about equity and inclusion: if 
something was said to make you uncomfortable (either by your instructor, a teaching/learning assistant, or a 
peer), please talk to your instructor about it and we will do what we can to address the issue. 
In this course, we will discuss and debate topics that people might be passionate about and hold close to their 
heart. Sometimes, in the spirit of learning, we might ask students to defend a viewpoint that they do not 
necessarily agree with. This is meant to promote understanding and a sense of empathy with others. These 
discussions and debates should be conducted respectfully with the goal of sharing perspectives and learning 
together. Ultimately, you will be entering the real world as computing professionals and encounter people with 
many different backgrounds and circumstances, including many who may disagree with your values. 
I wish to use your preferred name and pronouns. If that differs from your record in UMLearn, please let me know 
in person or by email. I encourage you to correct me or your peers if we use the incorrect name and/or pronouns. 
All language spoken or written in the course (e.g., chat, quizzes, assignments, presentations, and the term test) 
should be gender neutral or inclusive of all genders. Students are encouraged to use “they” or “their” as a singular 
pronoun. Language choices should be free from micro aggressions, especially relating to gender, race, age, and 
abilities. In graded materials, as shown in the grading guides, there will be deductions for gendered language 
and non-inclusive assumptions. 
If you have any specific concerns or require assistance due to particular needs, I encourage you to connect with 
Student Accessibility Services (SAS) to facilitate the implementation of accommodations.

LEARNING APPROACHES 
Attendance: Since attendance is so crucial for learning in the class, attendance will be taken each class, in the 
form of software records, group attendance and/or quiz questions. Student are expected to attend each 
scheduled class, and to be active and engaged with the course material and interactive exercises. Grades will be 
deducted for missed classes. Exceptions will be made for illness See Grading and Attendance for more details.  
Group Activities: The first week of the course will offer instruction on group work, group roles, and group 
communication skills. After registration closes, you will be assigned a group to work with for most of the term. 
Groups may be reassigned during the term. 
Interactive Lectures and In-Class Activities: This course is taught as a flipped classroom, meaning you will 
encounter the course material initially by assigned resources done outside of the classroom. Classroom time will 
be used for interactive lectures, in-class exercises, case studies, group discussions, guest speakers, and peer 
editing. Content discussed during in-class activities is quiz-able and testable. 
Case Studies: There are four main topics in the course, each which runs in a two-week block. For each topic, all 
students will read a case study, and a group of your peers will present details of the case resources, and facilitate a 
discussion about the case. Following this discussion, each student who did not present on the case will prepare 
and submit a Written Reflection. 
Term Test: The term test will be held in the last tutorial slot of the term. Students will be tested on all course 
materials for the term, and asked to synthesize connections between course components. Students will also be 
asked to explain, expand, and or describe the content and process of their written reflections. The term test is 
closed book; no notes are permitted.  
Peer Presentation: In groups, students will be required to present on an assigned case study related to the course 
topic. Presenters will lead group activities and discussions. Groups will present to a pod of approximately 12 students 
(including the presenting group).  
Workshops and Guest Speakers: Each course block includes a workshop or guest speaker. These workshops 
and speakers have been chosen to equip computer science students with real-life context for course topics, as well 
as to help students prepare for their future careers.  Attendance is required. Often, although not always, these 
workshops will be scheduled in the tutorial slot (Thursday at 2:30-3:45pm). 
Required Resources: A schedule of required resources indicates which readings/videos students are expected 
to complete BEFORE class. Many resources are available through the world wide web, but some will require access 
through the University of Manitoba Libraries website. Students must also expect to view videos which will require 
purchasing or accessing a paid-platform (e.g., Netflix) and should plan and budget accordingly. Resources are subject 
to change in content and date. 
Three-Stage Quizzes: Quizzes will be used to examine students’ timely completion and comprehension of the 
course resources, interactive lectures, and case-study resources. In a three-stage quiz, the first two stages are done 
individually, and the third stage is done as a group.  See “Graded Course Components”: for quiz details. 
Tutorials: Both sections A01 and A02 are in the Tutorial Section B01, held on Thursdays at 2:30-3:45pm. The tutorial 
slot will be used for quizzes and the term test,  and often for guest speakers. On weeks when the tutorial slot is used, 
the classes proceeding the tutorial will generally be cancelled and used to meet with upcoming presenting groups.  
Written Reflections: Students who did not present on a case study are required to submit a written reflection 
related to the topics in the case study. These reflections ask students to relate the course topics to their own 
personal life experiences, including the peer-led presentations and discussions.  Students will be provided with 
details on how and when they are permitted to use Generative AI for these written reflections. The term test will 
require students to reference their own written reflections. Written Reflections are generally due on the Friday after 
the case study peer presentation.

Syllabus for COMP 4620: Professional Practice in Computer Science (Winter 2025) 
Penner, C.  
GRADED COURSE COMPONENTS 
Three-Stage Quizzes (50%)  
• Quizzes will be used to examine students’ timely completion and comprehension of the course content. 
• QUIZ 1, QUIZ 2, QUIZ 3, and QUIZ 4 will be held at the end of each of the four main sections of the course. 
Each quiz is worth 16% 12.5%, for a total of 64 50%. 
• Three-Stage Quizzes are divided into three sections:  
o Section 1: Essay Question: Each quiz will begin with one essay question. This question will ask 
students to relate course readings and discussions to their own lives, and to other course 
resources.  
▪ Students will have around 25 minutes to write one essay question. 
▪ Students may bring in paper-based notes they have written or typed themselves. No 
computing devices will be permitted. Printouts of the articles are also not allowed. 
▪ This section of the quiz will be worth 10 marks (out of 20). Section 1 questions account 
for 24% of the term grade (6% each quiz).  
o Section 2: Reading Comprehension Questions (Individual):  Students will answer multi-select 
questions and short-answer questions that quiz for reading comprehension on the required 
readings/viewings.  
▪ Students will have around 20 minutes to answer these questions.  
▪ Student may bring in and use notes they have written themselves. 
▪ No external tools (including language translators or Generative AI) are allowed.  
▪ This section of the quiz is worth 9 marks (out of 20).  The second section questions 
account for 24% of the term grade (6% each quiz).  
o Section 3: Reading Comprehension Questions (Group): Question: In groups, students will write a 
quiz very similar to the quiz in Section 2. Students are encouraged to discuss each question with 
their group before answering.  
▪ Groups will have around 25 minutes to discuss and answer this section of the quiz.  
▪ This stage of the quiz is open book; all resources are available. 
▪ The third section accounts for 2% of the term grade (0.5% each quiz). 
• Quizzes will be given during class time. 
• Quizzes may include multiple-choice, multiple true-false questions, short-answer questions, and/or 
written response questions. Other question types may also be present. 
• Quiz questions will be based on all material within a given block, including: 1) interactive lectures, 2) in
class activities, 3) required resources (related to course topics and and/or workshop) 
• Quiz grades will be returned within 5 working days of the quiz date. 
• Missed Quiz Policy: Quizzes are due at the date and time specified on UMLearn. If a quiz is missed due to 
a health condition or family crisis, students should email the instructor at least 24 hours before the quiz or 
as soon as possible; for ONE quiz, at the instructor’s discretion, the quiz’s weight may be distributed to the 
remaining Quizzes.  Additional missed Quizzes will require consultation with an academic advisor. If a quiz 
is missed for any reason other than a health condition or family crisis, there are no make-up Quizzes, and 
the student will receive a grade of 0 on the missed quiz. Quizzes MUST BE WRITTEN IN PERSON.  Writing a 
quiz remotely without permission of the instructor will result in a zero on the quiz.  
• Grade Appeals: Quiz grades may be appealed within 6 days of the date grades were returned using a 
UMLearn form. Appeals using email or outside of the 6-day window will usually not be considered.  
Term Test (20%)  
• The TERM TEST will be held in the last two weeks of classes and will require students to review and 
synthesize material from the entire term. This quiz is worth 20%. Notes are not permitted for the term 
test.  
• A grade of 60% or higher on the Term Test is required to get a grade of C or higher in the course. Students 
with less than 60% on their Term Test will be given a grade of D in the course, unless their overall term 
grade is less than the D grade cut point, in which case they will receive a grade of F.

Penner, C.  
Written Reflections (20%) 
Written Reflections require students to respond to a question described in a Case Study OR to describe and reflect 
on the process of working in a group to prepare a case study. Written Reflections are used to develop and evaluate 
students’ critical thinking on course topics. More details:  
• Each written reflection will be worth 5% of the term grade, for a total of 10% 20%. 
• Students will submit a total of FOUR Written Reflections for grading: 
o THREE Written Reflections will be on Case Studies for which the student observed a different 
group present.  
o ONE Written Reflection on the group process will be due on the same week as the group’s case 
study presentation.  
• Written Reflections will be graded by the Instructor, Grader, and/or TA. 
• Written Reflections will receive a summative grade (e.g., x/5) and formative feedback. Formative feedback 
will generally be in the form of an audio file. All graded feedback will be returned using UMLearn.   
• Written Reflection Specifications, including instructions and grading guidelines, will be posted on 
UMLearn. 
• Written Reflections must be submitted using UMLearn. E-mailed or printed  assignments will not be 
considered.  
• Written Reflections are due by 11:59PM on the due date. Late assignments will be accepted for 48 hours 
without grading penalty. After 48 hours, assignments will generally not be accepted. 
• Grade Appeals: Assignment grades may be appealed within 6 days of the date grades were returned using 
a UMLearn form. Appeals using email or outside of the 6-day window will usually not be considered.  
• Referencing Style: Students should reference materials using the IEEE reference style.  
• A grade of 60% or higher on the Written Reflections (out of 20) is required to get a grade of C or higher 
in the course. Students with less than 60% on their cumulative Written Reflections will be given a grade of 
D in the course, unless their overall term grade is less than the D grade cut point, in which case they will 
receive a grade of F.  
Group Presentation and Discussion (10%) 
In groups, students will be required to prepare and present a live presentation of an assigned Case Study. The goals 
of the presentation are to introduce the case study, introduce peers to helpful resources to learn more about the 
cases, and to invite interaction and discussion about the case.  More details:    
• Each group will plan, produce, and present a live presentation on one assigned case study. 
• For grading purposes, each group must record their live presentation and submit a video of their 
presentation.  
• Following the video/presentation, each group must provide an interactive activity to their group. Your 
instructor will give you ideas for this activity.  
• After the interactive activity, the group will lead a live discussion. Due to privacy concerns, the discussion 
does not need to be recorded.  
• Group presentations will be presented to a “pod” of approximately 12-14 students (including the 
presenting group).  
• Group presentations will be graded by the Instructor, Grader, or TA.  
• A grade of 60% or higher on the Group Presentation is required to get a grade of C or higher in the course. 
Students with less than 60% on their Group Presentation will be given a grade of D in the course, unless 
their overall term grade is less than the D grade cut point, in which case they will receive a grade of F. 
Students who do not participate in the group presentation (as self-reported, reported by group members, 
AND/OR observed by the course instructor or TAs) will NOT receive the same grade as the rest of the group, 
and if their grade is less than 60%, they will receive a grade of D or F in the course. Exceptions will be made 
for students with pressing medical or family emergencies IF the instructor is informed before the 
presentation.

COURSE EXPECTATIONS 
Academic Integrity  
• Each student in this course is expected to abide by the University of Manitoba Academic Integrity 
principles. Always remember to reference the work of others that you have used. Also be advised that 
you are required to complete your assignments independently unless otherwise specified. If you are 
encouraged to work in a team, ensure that your project complies with the academic integrity regulations. 
You must do your own work during exams. Inappropriate  collaborative behavior and violation of other 
Academic Integrity principles, will lead to the serious disciplinary action.  Visit the Academic Calendar, 
Student Advocacy, and Academic Integrity web pages for more information and support.   
• Examples of academic misconduct include: 
o submitting assignments or Quizzes which are not entirely your own work or providing your work 
to another student or students; 
o use of unauthorized material during a test or examination; or 
o sharing any part of your assignment or quiz or test with another person. 
• You will be required to confirm your agreement to an Honesty Declaration before submitting each 
assignment or writing any quiz or test. 
• All students in this course must read and meet the expectations described in the Expectations for 
Individual Work in Computer Science (https://sci.umanitoba.ca/cs/expectations/). Both Written 
Reflections and the first two stages of the Quizzes are considered individual work.  
• Group work and group projects are subject to the rules of academic dishonesty. Academic Integrity rules 
continue to apply to Group work and projects. In this course, Group work includes Stage 3 of all Quizzes, 
and the Group Presentation.  
• The list of suggested minimum penalties assessed by the Faculty of Science for acts of academic 
dishonesty is available on the Faculty of Science webpage: 
https://umanitoba.ca/science/sites/science/files/2023-09/faculty-of-science-academic-misconduct
penalties_1.pdf   
• In the past, students have incorrectly thought they can paraphrase a paragraph someone else wrote as 
long as they reword some of the phrasing. This approach will be flagged for an academic integrity 
investigation. You must word all ideas in your own words. If you use ideas from a source, you must cite 
the source.  
Attendance and Participation 
Attendance in this class is mandatory since each class will involve discussion, group work and/or in-class activities 
that cannot be duplicated outside of class. Class discussion and group work are crucial tools to explore, practice, 
and improve your professional and critical-thinking skills. Attending class in person but not paying attention to the 
course content will also result in a penalty. Arriving late or leaving early will generally be marked as absent. 
Attendance Record not filled in due to lateness, momentary absence, or mismatch in name:  
Students can view the attendance record in UMLearn. Attendance records will be posted shortly after class. Any 
concerns with the attendance record must be submitted using a UMLearn form on the day of the missed class. If 
the attendance record is posted more than three hours after class, students will have 24 hours after the 
attendance record is posted. If a student is late to class and misses the attendance, they must use the Attendance 
Concerns form on the same day as they failed to register their attendance, or they will be marked absent with the 
associated grade penalty. Attendance concerns not submitted during this time window will not be considered.  
Note: The easiest way to avoid attendance concerns is to attend class on time.  
Self-Declared Illness, Travel or Family Emergency: Occasionally students will not be able to attend class due to 
family emergencies, travel difficulties, and illness. Although this is understandable, any absence reflects a loss of 
leaning, which is why all absences result in at least a small grade penalty. For ONE absence, if a student wishes to 
contact the instructor for an additional assignment that relates to the learning objectives of the missed class, they 
may do that, and they will not be marked as absent for that ONE class. The make-up assignment must be 
10 
Syllabus for COMP 4620: Professional Practice in Computer Science (Winter 2025) 
Penner, C.  
submitted within FIVE days of the absence.  This option is not available for students who miss classes due to 
vacations. If students ask for a make-up assignment for an absence due to a Co-op interview, the student must 
include an email from the Co-op office stating the conflict with the course was unavoidable. 
After one missed class, students will NOT be able to request an additional assignment except for in highly unusual 
circumstances, and will receive grade deductions as described under GRADING. Students who are concerned 
about the grade deductions for missing multiple classes should consult with a student advisor to manage their 
absences.  
Note Absence deductions follow the Fibonacci sequence, meaning that the penalties increase quickly after the 
second absence. The attendance penalties are cumulative, to a maximum penalty of 88%.  See GRADES for more 
details. Students unable to attend several classes should note the severe grade penalties, and seek the 
consultation of a Student Advisor. 
Falsifying attendance records is considered academic dishonesty.  
Minimum Technical Requirements 
Students enrolled in the course must ensure they satisfy the following minimum technological requirements: - - - 
A computing device to bring to each lecture that can connect to the U of M Wi-Fi, 
A computing device to create and edit documents, 
Access to an internet connection capable of streaming videos and downloading software. 
Students will frequently need to access course materials during class time.  
UMLearn 
This course relies heavily on UMLearn. Students should familiarize themselves with this interface. See your instructor 
if you have questions about using or accessing UMLearn.  
Inclusive Conduct and Language 
This course requires and assumes support for all students. All language spoken or written in the course (e.g.: chat, 
Quizzes, assignments, presentations) should be gender neutral or inclusive of all genders. Students are encouraged 
to use “they” or “their” as a singular pronoun. Language choices should be free from micro aggressions, especially 
relating to gender, race, age, and abilities. In graded materials, as shown in the grading guides, there will be 
deductions for gendered language and non-inclusive assumptions. 
Zoom Protocols 
If, due to sickness, pedagogical requirements, or room limitations a class must move to remote delivery, we will use 
Zoom. These are the Zoom protocols:  
On Zoom, you are expected to present yourselves as you would in a shared physical space. Students should be fully 
dressed. Use a screen background (if your device allows this) or, if possible, position your background against a wall 
or corner to preserve your home’s privacy. Please mute yourselves unless you are talking. Please help your classmates 
(and instructor) by setting a standard of showing focussed attention for the duration of the class. Turn on cameras 
for group work.  
Class Communication 
You are required to obtain and use your University of Manitoba email account for all communication between 
yourself and the university. All communication must comply with the Electronic Communication with Student 
Policy: 
http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/community/electronic_communication_with_stu
 dents_policy.html.  
Ethical and Legal Use of Technology 
It is the general University of Manitoba policy that all technology resources are to be used in a responsible, efficient, 
ethical, and legal manner.

Syllabus for COMP 4620: Professional Practice in Computer Science (Winter 2025) 
Penner, C.  
Instructor Conduct 
I will treat you with respect, and work to facilitate your learning in this course. In particular, I will:  
• Be available for office hours by appointment;  
• Work with the Graders and TAs to get your assignments returned to you in a prompt manner, with the goal 
of returning all assignments within ten working days; 
• Work with the Graders and TAs to offer commentary (usually an audio file) on your assignments, through 
UMLearn;  
• Use evidence-based teaching strategies to facilitate student learning. 
Illness 
If the Instructor, TA, or Graders become ill, all timelines in the syllabus and course website may be revised.  Should 
the instructor be ill, they will work with the CS Department to find a substitute to continue teaching the class in
person.  In the event a suitable instructor cannot be found, the instructor may give the lecture synchronously or 
provide asynchronous content through Zoom or UMLearn for up to 5 days.  An email will be sent to students’ UM 
email and a posting will be made on UM Learn the night before class if this is the case.  
If students become ill, do not come to campus. Instead of a sick note, students are required by the university to 
complete a self-declaration form. See Medical Notes and Other Documentation in Appendix A. If you miss a 
class, and/or quiz due to illness, email your instructor as soon as possible to arrange an alternate method for 
assessment Accommodations will be reasonable but not ideal. Such an arrangement will generally entail moving 
the weight of the quiz and/or assignment to the term test. In rare cases, students may be offered an extension or 
an alternate assignment.  
No more than one assignment and one quiz may have their weight transferred to a different course component; 
remaining missed quizzes and assignments will generally receive a grade of 0. If a student has a self-declared 
absence resulting in missing more than one quiz and one assignment, the absence is no longer deemed temporary, 
and students are advised to speak with an advisor in their faculty/college/school of registration in these instances. 
Recording Class Lectures 
No audio or video recording of lectures or presentations is allowed in any format, openly or surreptitiously, in whole 
or in part without permission from your instructor. Course materials (both paper and digital) are for the participant’s 
private study and research.  
Due to the highly interactive nature of the class time, limited class time will be recorded. This is done to protect 
students’ privacy and encourage class participation. If you miss a class, the best way to find out about the missed 
content is to review the posted notes and complete the assigned readings. 
Case Study presentations should be recorded by the presenting group (only) for marking purposes. 
Using Copyrighted Material 
We will use copyrighted content in this course. I have ensured that the content I use is appropriately acknowledged 
and is copied in accordance with copyright laws and university guidelines. Copyrighted works, including those 
created by me, are made available for private study and research, and must not be distributed in any format without 
permission. Do not upload copyrighted works to a learning management system (such as UMLearn), or any website, 
uncles an exception to the Copyright Act applies or written permission has been confirmed. For more information, 
see the University’s Copyright Office website at http://umanitoba.ca/copyright/ or contact 
um_copyright@umanitoba.ca.  
Using Generative AI 
Unless otherwise specified, students are NOT permitted to use Generative AI tools for writing the first drafts of 
their written reflections, nor for any content submitted in a quiz or test. For certain assignments, the instructor 
will specify and guide the students in using Generative AI to help with the assignments. See assignment guidelines 
and grading guides for more details. .

Health and Safety 
The UM is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. 
Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic or 
other campus-wide emergency, it is possible that this course will move to a fully remote delivery 
format. Should the instructor be required to stay at home for an extended period and an alternate 
instructor not be available, the course may move temporarily to a remote delivery format. 
Mask Wearing 
In a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students to observe all Covid 
guidelines set by the University (https://umanitoba.ca/coronavirus ) While on campus and in class, you 
must wear masks as stipulated in current University policies, procedures, and guidelines. The University 
highly recommends the use of KN-95 masks; the minimum requirement is a ATSM Level 2 Medical mask. 
Both mask types are available at many locations on campus. Students who fail to comply are subject to 
disciplinary action in accordance with the Student Discipline Bylaw and the Non-Academic Misconduct 
and Concerning Behaviour Procedure. 
Instructors are told to follow the protocols specified in COVID-19 information for staff, faculty, and 
researchers for non-compliance with masking.  Students should not eat or drink during class time. 
Illness 
Remember: STAY HOME IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS OR ARE ILL. If you become ill, we highly recommend 
that you self-isolate; you should notify your instructor by email so you can develop a plan to complete 
the course learning outcomes while you are absent. 
What to do if you become ill while at UM: 
1. Leave the classroom, lab, or workspace immediately. Continue to wear your mask while leaving the 
premises and/or while waiting for transportation. 
2. Perform hand hygiene (soap and water or hand sanitizer) and avoid contact with others and minimize 
contact with the physical environment.  
3. Once at home, complete the MB self-assessment and follow the directions that are provided. 
4. Inform your instructor(s) or, if in residence, the appropriate individual.  The Instructor will discuss 
with you arrangements for extensions, deferrals or make-up assignments as required. 
5. Please remain off-campus and all UM facilities until cleared to return in accordance with self
assessment, testing results, and UM recommended isolation procedures. 
Recommended transportation options (in order):  
1. Drive yourself home. 
2. Pick-up by family or friend – remember to keep your mask on and to distance yourself as 
much as possible, and where possible, open a window to improve ventilation. 
3. Pickup by taxi/Uber: 
a. Remain masked and perform hand hygiene before entering the vehicle. 
b. Avoid touching the inside of the vehicle 
c. Keep your mask on for the duration of the ride 
d. Where possible, open a window to improve ventilation.

Sexual Violence Support and Education  
Sexual violence affects people of all ages, sexual orientations, genders, gender identities, abilities, and 
relationship statuses. At the UM, we are committed to ensuring a respectful work and learning 
environment for all. We want to build a safe and inclusive campus community where survivors of sexual 
violence know they can receive the supports they need to succeed, both academically and personally. 
The Sexual Violence Resource Centre, located at 537 UMSU University Centre (Fort Garry campus) 
provides support, resources, information and referral services for any student, faculty or staff member 
who has been affected by sexual violence. 
Indigenous Students 
Staff, faculty, and Elders are well-equipped to ensure your university experience is as beneficial, 
accessible, and successful as possible. Visit the Indigenous Student Experience website for more 
information on the supports and services available. 
International Students 
The transition to a new country and a new academic system can be both exciting and overwhelming. 
The International Centre (IC) is here to help you settle into life at UM.  Visit the International Students 
website for more information. 
Academic Accommodations 
Students who have, or think they may have, a disability (e.g., mental illness, learning, medical, hearing, 
injury-related, visual) are encouraged to contact Student Accessibility Services to arrange a confidential 
consultation. Instructors are notified by Student Accessibility Services what accommodations their 
registered students require which will help the instructor determine fair, feasible and reasonable 
academic accommodations without compromising academic standards. This takes time and planning, so 
reach out at the start of term. 
SAS students can write their exams and tests in spaces organized by the SAS Exam Centre however they 
must register with the SAS Exam Centre a few weeks in advance.  Please be sure to do so to receive the 
accommodations. 
Medical Notes and Other Documentation 
The Self-Declaration for Brief and Temporary Absences Procedure and Policy is effective as of 
September 1, 2022 and therefore students will not be required to present medical or other 
documentation for absences due to extenuating circumstances of 120 hours or less, however this form 
must be completed and submitted to the instructor in lieu of the documentation.  Please note that 
further documentation may be requested from students who claim multiple temporary absences or 
absences for more than 120 hours. 
Short-Term Academic Accommodations (up to 120 consecutive hours absences) 
As we emerge from the pandemic, the University still has the health and safety of its community at top 
of mind. Since your classes are held in-person, please make sure you follow the  University’s COVID-19 
Health and Safety Protocols. Notably, exercise good hand hygiene, stay home if you are ill and you must 
wear a mask when attending lecture/labs and on campus.

Syllabus for COMP 4620: Professional Practice in Computer Science (Winter 2025) 
Penner, C.  - - - 
Students who miss a lab or assessment due to an extenuating brief or temporary absence 
should complete a  self-declaration for brief and temporary student absences form and submit 
it to their instructor within 48 hours of the end of the brief absence. The instructor will discuss 
with the student how the missed work can be made up.   
Students absent for over 120 hours as a result of medical, compassionate, University 
scholastic, University athletic or religious event will require official documentation to explain 
the absence.  Students should reach out to instructors early if absences are anticipated. 
Personal vacations and work requirements are not considered acceptable absences.  
Long-Term Academic Accommodations 
Students with long-term academic accommodations are usually registered with Student Accessibility 
Services. The long-term academic accommodations are usually to accommodate long term physical or 
mental illness and accommodations can be in the form of notetaking, interpreting, assistive technology, 
and assessment accommodations.  
Final Exams 
Students who have conflicting scheduled exams should contact their faculty’s academic advisors as soon 
as possible.  Students who miss their exam due to extenuating circumstances can apply for a deferred 
exam.   Please note that the granting of a deferred exam is not necessarily guaranteed. 
Missed Lecture Notes 
Students missing lecture notes as a result of absences are responsible for obtaining the missed content 
on their own accord.  Contact a classmate or the course instructor for their notes but please be aware 
the instructor is not obliged to create notes for students as a result of absences.

    Attendance : Since attendance is so crucial for learning in the class, attendance is mandatory and will be tracked. 
See your instructor if you have any concerns. Flipped Classroom: This course is taught as a flipped classroom, meaning you will encounter the course material initially by assigned resources done outside of the class time. Classroom time will be used for interactive lectures, in-class exercises, and group discussions, and peer editing. There may be a small period of direct instruction as needed but the expectation is the lectures are watched beforehand. This is why the class time slot will not be the entire 3 hours as you will be putting some time beforehand. Here is a video that tells you more about the flipped classroom style: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdKzSq_t8k8 A note on this as well: there is always room for change. I provide all video lectures (you do not need to seek them out online however it doesn’t hurt to find more resources). If you ever need additional resources or face time with me, I’m always available for that. In-class Activities :These activities will vary from week to week and lend themselves to the material taught and the assignments. Required Resources : The only required resource to be completed before class we be the supplied video lecture. Supplemental resources such as additional lectures, chapter readings or examples may be provided but are there to enhance your learning and are not part of the “bare minimum” requirement. Quizzes : These will take place insteadofiClicker questions. 2 stage quizzes will be used. This is where you will write a quiz alone, and then have an opportunity to discuss it with your peers before writing it again, ideally achieving a higher mark (don’t worry, no loss if you don’t, read on for more on this). Quizzes will be completed on UMLearn. Assignments: There will be 4 assignments. The release and due date information can be found in the course schedule and the UMLearn calendar. Assignments are to be handed in on UMLearn. Term Test: There will be two term tests in this course. These term tests will not be cumulative. The first is June 7th, in class and the second will be July 19th. Please let me know immediately if there will be a conflict. Term tests are done in crowdmark. Labs: Labs will be released Mondays at 12:00 am and will be due on Fridays at 11:59pm. You must submit your completed labs on UMLearn in the appropriate submission box. Labs will cover course material and aide in your understanding of the topics. Final Exam: The final Examination will be scheduled by the department. Once I know when it is, I will let you all know. It will be cumulative from the start of the course to the end. Classes will follow the general flow: Group activity Debrief of activity Break Small lecture/presentation Open work time/office hours* *in class time will not take the full 3 hours most weeks (because that’s insane on a Monday night in summer).

Calendar Description
(Lab required) This course is recommended for students in mathematically rich disciplines,
including Statistics, Mathematics, Actuarial Science, Computer Science, and related interdisciplinary programs. Topics to be covered include: summarizing and displaying large datasets,
sampling, estimation and significance tests, probability calculations, random variables and
probability distributions, introduction to regression and correlation analysis, statistical software.
Not to be held with STAT 1000, STAT 1001, STAT 2000, STAT 2001 and STAT 2220.
Prerequisite: Minimum of 70% in Pre-calculus Mathematics 40S or a grade of B or better in
Mathematical Skills (MSKL 100) offered by Extended Education or equivalent.
1
Course Goals
By the end of the course we would like students to:
• Be able to make appropriate choices for numerical and graphical summaries for a wide
variety of data sets.
• Formulate statistical hypotheses and perform the appropriate tests for common onesample and two-sample data problems.
• Identify statistical questions in real world examples and think critically about data
sources and assumptions made in studies.
• Be able to effectively communicate basic statistical ideas and concepts to non-statisticians.
• Use R to create graphical and numerical summaries as well as carry out all learned
statistical tests.
STAT 1150 is designed to help prepare students for further study in statistics by giving
a broad summary of important ideas in probability and inference. There is an emphasis
on understanding the underlying principles behind the methods used so that the students
can make judicious choices in their further studies what method should be applied. This
course will introduce students to the use of statistical computing software to not only apply
methods but explore the mechanics through simulations.
Textbook, Readings, and Course Materials
Required Textbook: Statistics: 13th Edition by James T. McClave and Terry T Sincich
The textbook is available as an e-text through the purchase of Statistic with MyLab
which is required for the course. Paper copies of the textbook are available through the
bookstore if students would like a hard copy as well. An access code to the textbook and
MyLab is available for purchase through the University of Manitoba Bookstore.
Supplementary Readings: Occasionally I will assign supplementary readings in the form
of short articles or website URLs to complement the lectures. These will be made available
through the course website on UMLearn under the course content for the appropriate unit
or on the class discussion forum.
Required Materials: All students will be required to purchase and bring with them to
class a scientific non-programmable calculator. It will also be required for all quizzes, the
midterms, and the final exam.

Course Technology
Use of Technology in the Classroom: Please ensure that any technology used in the
class is used in a responsible manner that is mindful of the students around you. You may
have cell phones on your person as long as they are kept on silent and are not brought above
table height. You may use laptops or tablets in class to help with note taking or follow along
with any computer demonstrations but please keep only academic matters up on your screen
and refrain from distracting the students around you.
R Studio: In this class we will be making use of the statistical software R. You may
download R from http://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/ and the R Studio program from
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. R Studio will also be available from the statistics computer lab. If you require assistance installing R Studio, you may
come and see me in my office hours. We will go over the basic installation and use in the
first lab of the semester.
Throughout the course I will demonstrate how to carry out many of the calculations
using R and the labs will make extensive use of R for doing demonstrations and simulations.
UMLearn: All course material will be posted on UMLearn in the Contents section. All
important dates can be found on the calendar and I will make class announcements through
the news feed on the course website. All grades will be posted in the UMLearn Gradebook
In addition, there will also be discussion forums available. For each class I will open up
a discussion forum where I will post the material covered that class, any announcements,
and suggestions for preparation for the next class. Please be in the habit of checking it after
every class. If you have questions about anything during the lecture or any announcements,
you can ask directly on the forum for the relevant class. There will also be a discussion forum
opened up for each lab section where you can ask questions of your T.A. or your fellow lab
3
mates.
All discussion will be monitored closely by me. Please be courteous in posing questions
and replying to questions on the board. Your best effort should be made to make clear
questions in complete English sentences.
Crowdmark: All quizzes, the midterm, and the final exam will be marked using the Crowdmark software, an online grading tool. All exams will be written on provided paper and then
scanned for grading. Additional instructions will be given prior to the first assessment to
ensure the examinations can be scanned correctly. Upon completion of the quizzes and the
midterm, an electronically marked copy of your exam will be emailed to your UManitoba
e-mail address. I will send out an email when the marked copies have been sent. Please
check your spam folders if you do not see it in your inbox.

In my class I expect you to:
• Attend lectures and listen attentively.
• Participate in small group activities when asked.
• Use technology respectfully as outlined in the syllabus.
• Come prepared the class with paper, writing utensils, a scientific calculator, and any
needed statistical tables.
• Arrive to your exams with writing utensils, a scientific calculator, and a ruler if appropriate.
• Do your utmost to arrive on time and be as quiet as possible should you unavoidably
need to arrive late or leave early.
• Not talk to your neighbours while I am lecturing.
• Ask questions during my lecture as needed and interrupt me if I write something
incorrect on the overhead.
• Be respectful of your lab T.A.s and extend to them all courtesies you would extend to
me.
• Be mindful of my time outside of class and allow me sufficient time to answer emails
or look in to your concerns.

• Not come to class when you are feeling ill.
• Look to the class folder on UMLearn and review all material if you miss class, as well
as connect with a fellow classmate to get any missed notes.
Expectations: You Can Expect Me To
As your instructor you can expect me to:
• Treat you with respect inside and outside of the classroom.
• Arrive early to class and remain for a few minutes afterwards to answer questions.
• Come prepared to my lectures.
5
• Be available during my office and make my best attempt to provide sufficient notice if
an office hour needs to be moved or canceled.
• Answer your questions thoughtfully and follow up if needed.
• Listen to your feedback/concerns and do my best to take reasonable requests in to
account.
• Monitor the lab demonstrators and ensure quizzes are retuned in a reasonable time

• Set assessments that are reasonable and contain questions that match the learning
objectives for the course.
• Be passionate about my subject and what I teach.
Should I be ill, I will work with my Department to find a substitute to continue teaching the
class in-person. In the event a suitable instructor cannot be found, I may give the lecture
synchronously or provide asynchronous content through Zoom or UMLearn for up to 5 days.
An email will be sent to students’ UM email and a posting will be made on UMLearn the
night before class, or as soon as possible, if this is the case.
Academic Dishonesty: It is important that you understand what constitutes academic
dishonesty and that you are familiar with the very serious consequences. Links to resources
that describe academic dishonesty (including plagiarism, cheating, inappropriate collaboration and examination impersonation, as well as typical penalties) can be found at:
http://www.umanitoba.ca/student/resource/student_advocacy/academicintegrity/
students/a-to-i-what-is-academic-integrity.html#cheating-on-exams
http://www.umanitoba.ca/student/resource/student_advocacy/academicintegrity/
students/student-academic-misconduct-faq.html
https://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/students/undergraduate-students/
academic-resources/academic-integrity-2/
I expect students to hold themselves to the highest standards of academic integrity.
Impersonation, cheating for hire websites, and using unauthorized materials are very serious
offences. I expect you to be honest, conduct yourself with integrity, actively encourage your
peers to conduct themselves with integrity, and uphold the value of what a degree from the
University of Manitoba means. When you are in doubt, always consult with your instructor.
My door is always open for discussions on the boundaries of what is and what is not allowed.
I will also clearly state what the ground rules are for collaboration on any assignment. Asking
is a sign of integrity, not a signal that you might think of cheating. Always bear in mind that
what is considered a violation of academic integrity can vary from course to course (even
with the same instructor) so it is always important to ask and clarify. Ignorance is not an
acceptable excuse for academic misconduct.

Recording of Class Lectures
Your instructor and the University of Manitoba hold copyright over the course materials,
presentations and lectures which form part of this course. No audio or video recording of
lectures or presentations is allowed in any format, openly or surreptitiously, in whole or in
part without permission from your instructor. If you require an audio recording to help you
play back and study, I require you to first ask my permission and it must only be used for
your personal use. You should take care to pause and not record your classmates when we
go into group discussions. While my lectures are not being recorded, I will have the previous
year’s bite size recordings teaching basic concepts and most questions. This will not align
100% with questions I do in class this year but will contain all of the basic coverage to help
you study and get caught up should you miss class.
Class Communication: The University requires all students to activate an official University email account. Please note that all communication between your instructor and you as
a student must comply with the Electronic Communication with Students Policy. Please see
http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/community/electronic_
communication_with_students_policy.html
You are required to obtain and use your U of M email account for all communication between
yourself and the university.
E-mail: To schedule an appointment outside of office hours or to ask a question that would
not be suitable for the discussion forums (it involves your personal information or the answer
would not be of interest to other students) you may email me at my university email address.
Please note that if your question is answered on the course outline (which will be posted on
UMLearn), or in the discussion posts, I will simply direct you to find the answer yourself.
This is not because I want to be unhelpful but because I teach three different classes and I
have over 460 students as well as many other service commitments. Time spent answering
emails with easily searchable answers is time I not able to spend productively helping everyone. The subject line of your emails should contain “STAT 1150 A01”. All emails should
start with an opening salutation, be written in complete English sentences and be signed
with your name and student number. If you are asking a question about a practice problem,
please include a screenshot of the question, the solution (if applicable), and whatever work
you have attempted. Please note that I will not divulge grades over email. All emails received during the work week will be replied to within 24 hours. While I will generally check
my work emails over the weekend in case there is an emergency, you can expect a reply to
non-urgent matters received over the weekend by Monday at noon.
Office Hours: My office hours are listed at the top of the course outline. You do not need
to make an appointment and may just show up to ask any questions that you may have.
This is the perfect time to ask questions about course material, your assignment, review

Course Schedule and Evaluation
Please see the course schedule handout for the complete class schedule, including due dates.
Please note that all dates for content coverage in these schedules are approximate and subject to minor changes. I will assign some questions as videos to watch at home for questions
that are repetitive and/or similar to other class examples.
Lab Expectations: This course comes with a mandatory lab component that begins during the first full week of class. The lab will be run by graduate and senior undergraduate
students from the Department of Statistics with previous lab demonstrating experience.
Eights labs will contain activities and additional instruction. The material covered is
testable and is not necessarily also covered during the lecture section so it is important that
you attend. These labs will have a large group work component and require participation
in group discussions. I expect that you will treat your classmates and lab demonstrators respectfully and that you will contribute meaningfully and enthusiastically to the discussions.
Several of these labs will have a short pre-lab activity that I expect for you to complete
prior to the start of the lab. Please bring with you writing materials, any preparatory work,
and a calculator. You may wish to bring with you a computer to follow along with the R code.
Three labs will be taken up by quizzes with short answer questions that require you to
show your work. Please bring with you writing utensils, a ruler, and a calculator to all quiz
labs. It is very important that you write your quiz in the section in which you are registered.
If you write the quiz of another lab section, you will receive a grade of 0 with no exceptions.
The best 2 out of 3 quizzes will be counted. If you miss a quiz due to illness, you do not
need to submit anything, it will automatically be counted as your dropped quiz.
You can see the class schedule handout for the contents of the lab in any given week.
Note there is no lab the week of February 27th - March 3rd (the first midterm).
Grading:
The following will compromise your course mark:
Midterms (2) /30
Quizzes (Best 2 of 3) /10
MyLab Assignments /10
R Assignments (2) /10
Participation/Reflections /5
Final Exam /35
All marks with the exception of the MyLab assignments will be posted on the gradebook in
UMLearn. The MyLab final marks will be on the MyLab gradebook. Only the final grade,
converted to be out of 10, will appear in the UMLearn gradebook after the last day of classes.
9
The following are the minimum percentage grades required to receive each of the various
letter grades: A+ (90%), A (80%), B+ (75%), B (70%), C+ (65%), C (60%), D (50%).
These are guaranteed grades and the cutoffs will not be adjusted. I round grades ending
in 0.5 or higher up subject to the condition that a student has been actively participating
throughout the term and has not forfeited most of their bonus/participation marks.
There is an additional requirement for obtaining a C+ in the course: to obtain a grade
of C+ or better, you must obtain at least 50% on the final examination.
Midterm Info: There are two midterms for this course that will be written in class on
Wednesday, March 1st and Monday, March 27th. It will consist of a 50 minute individual
test followed up by a second 20 minute group portion. For this second portion you will
randomly be divided into groups of 3-5 students. Your mark on your midterm will be the
better score of 100% your individual mark or weighted as 85% your individual mark plus
15% your group mark. Please allow for the class period to extend to 3:50 if the transition
time takes a bit longer. More information on the two-stage exam and pedagogical reasons
for the testing will be provided in class. You may bring in one single-sided 8.5x11 sheet of
paper with you into the midterm.
If you miss the midterm due illness, you must complete the self declaration form and
hand it in to your professor within 48 hours. The weight of the midterm you do write will
be increased to 20% and your final exam weight will increase to 45%.
The first midterm will cover units 1-3 and the second midterm will cover units 4-5. It
consists of long and short answer questions. For quizzes, the midterm test and the final examination: (i) nonprogrammable handheld calculators are permitted (graphing calculators
are not permitted), (ii) electronic devices, such as cell phones or headphones, are prohibited,
(iii) statistical tables will be provided.
Quiz Info: There will be three short quizzes over the course of the term. I will inform students of the exact material covered on each quiz at least one week in advance. Approximate
coverage can be found on the lab schedule. I will let you know in advance which formulas
are provided. You may not bring in a formula sheet.
Quizzes account for 10% of your final grade. Your percentage grade for quizzes will be
calculated using the best two of three quiz marks. Note that this policy is designed to
allow for students to miss one lab due to outside circumstances without requiring a sick note
and is not primarily designed to increase the grade. They will be graded within one week
and marks will be posted on the Gradebook. There will be no make-up quizzes.
MyLab Assignments: Most weeks by Thursday morning I will put a short 2-3 question
(with possible multiple parts) assignment up on MyLab. They will all consist of multiple
choice or short answer questions that are graded automatically by the system. These are
10
intended to be quick, 15 minute assignments to allow you to self assess and practice easy
questions from the week. You will have multiple attempts at the short answer questions and
have the ability to see guided sample questions. I will have a “practice” assignment that
is not for marks so that you can get used to the system. Further details on how attempts
work will be given then. As these are designed to be self assessment and keep you on pace,
I highly recommend that you complete them by the intended due dates. However, to allow
flexibility, I will not be assigning late marks. It is to your own detriment if you do not keep
pace. The last day to submit MyLab assignments for marks is the day after the last day of
classes.
R Assignments: You will have two assignments that will be computing assignments done
in R Markdown and turned in electronically by email by 11:59 on their due date. The required files will be posted in the class portal. Information on how to complete them will be
posted as a video file in UMLearn.
Participation / Reflections: Throughout the course there will be small activities that
will comprise your participation marks. Some of these will be practice activities such as the
Getting To Know You Survey or the R Practice Assignment. Many classes we will be doing
reflections where I will ask a prompt question and you will be asked to submit a written
response at the end of class (worth 2 marks each). There may also be a small in class group
activity for marks. As long as you receive a minimum of 70% of the available marks, you
will receive 5/5. If you receive between 50-69% of the available marks, you will receive 3/5.
If you receive less than 50% of the available marks, you will receive 0/5. As there will be
plenty of extra marks for practice activities and you only need to receive 70% of the total
marks, as long as you are attending most classes, you should receive 5/5 without issue. The
marks are nearly entirely for honest effort at completion as opposed to correctness.
Practice Questions: Through out the course I will provide extra practice problems in pdf
form, provide questions in UMLearn quizzes not for marks, and suggest questions from the
textbook. These are not for marks but you should complete them for the extra practice. The
pdf questions in particular will be helpful as they were written by me and will reflect the
way I ask questions on the quizzes and tests. You will also find additional practice problems
on the MyLab portal under the study plan.
Final Exam Info: The final exam will be 3 hours in duration and scheduled by the registrar’s office. You may bring one double-sided 8.5x11 sheet of paper with you as a formula
sheet. The final exam will cover Units 1 – 7, with emphasis on Units 6 – 7. Should you miss
the final exam or require a deferred, please contact your home faculty. I do not personally
handle any deferred exam requests

Course Description:
The aim of this course is to foster the ability to apply rational standards in forming and evaluating our
beliefs. This is not an easy thing to do for anyone as we all face obstacles to rational thought in the form
of personal biases. But with hard work we can come to recognize these biases and learn to think
critically. The practical skills acquired over the semester will serve you throughout your studies and
beyond the classroom. You will learn to identify, evaluate, and construct reasoned arguments for and
against various positions on a wide range of topics. Since the aim of the course is practical, we will often
work through exercises collectively in class. We might have to break up into smaller groups in order to
do so effectively, depending on the size of the class.

    Course description
Introduction to the representation, implementation, and analysis of common data structures:
stacks, queues, hash tables, binary and balanced trees. Algorithms for manipulating data
structures will be analyzed using asymptotic notation.
Instructor
Zoey Kitt

• Office hours: Monday/Wednesday/Friday 10:30am-11:30am in E2-422A
• No appointments are needed. If you cannot attend office hours, or if you prefer to meet
remotely, please contact me by email.
Course goals
Data structures form the backbone of every interesting application that has ever been built and
that ever will be built. Being able to implement and analyze data structures is the first step to
being able to implement and analyze real-world applications.
This course focuses on implementing common abstract data types (ADTs) using fundamental
data structures. The data structures include arrays, linked lists, binary search trees, binary
heaps, hash tables, adjacency lists, and adjacency matrices. The ADTs implemented include
stacks, queues, priority queues, dictionaries, and graphs. For each ADT, multiple
implementations are studied, as are algorithms to support each of the ADT’s operations, and
the corresponding running times and space requirements are analyzed.
By the end of this course, students will:
• Specify an abstract data type and its corresponding interface.
• Implement the common abstract data types: stack, queue, priority queue, dictionary, and
graph, along with their associated operations, using various (appropriately selected) data
structures.
• Implement common data structures and their associated operations, including a doubly
linked list, a binary search tree, a binary heap, and a hash table.
• Analyze the running times and space requirements of every data structure/algorithm
implemented
Prerequisites
May not be held with the former COMP 2061. Prerequisite: COMP 1020 or COMP 1021.
Textbook
No textbook is required and we will not follow any particular book. It is recommended that you
have access to a recent textbook on data structures and algorithms. Two options are posted as
pdfs on UM Learn under Content/Supplementary Resources. As per the Academic Integrity
and Copyright policies, submitting textbook material as your own is unacceptable and will be
dealt with accordingly.

Technology and contact
Technology
The programming language used in COMP 2140 is Java. It is recommended that you use the
programming environment that you are already familiar with from COMP 1020. Please ensure
that you meet the following minimum technological requirements:
• Use of a computing device with the ability to view, create, and edit documents, and install
software.
• An internet connection capable of streaming video, accessing web content, and
downloading and uploading documents.
It is strongly recommended that you use some kind of removable storage or cloud storage to
back up your work. Computer failure is not an acceptable excuse for late assignments.
You must also ensure that you have access to the following services:
• The COMP 2140 page on UM Learn
• Crowdmark
Communication
Any questions that you have about assignments and course materials should be posted to the
course forum on UM Learn. The course forum has been configured to allow anonymous posts.
I may (politely!) reply to e-mails asking about course material or assignments by asking to post
the question to the forum. I want to make sure that all students in the course have the same
consistent information to work from for course materials and assignments.
If you have questions that are specific to you, the best way to contact me is by email. Please
include “COMP 2140” in the subject line.
Volume permitting, I will reply to emails and forum posts within 2 business days. I will only reply
to emails and forum posts during business hours (9:00am-5:00pm Monday to Friday, excluding
holidays).
The University requires all students to activate an official University of Manitoba email account,
and use this account for all communication between yourself and the university. Please note
that all communication between the instructor and you as a student must comply with the
Electronic Communication with Students policy.
Assessment
Academic integrity policies
You are expected to familiarize yourself with the Computer Science Department expectations
for individual work. These expectations apply to all graded components of this course:
assignments, quizzes, and final exam.
The Faculty of Science takes academic integrity very seriously. Any evidence of academic
dishonesty on assignments or tests will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for
potential disciplinary actions.
The University Student Discipline By-Law may be accessed here. Information from the Faculty
of Science regarding Academic Integrity can be found here.
Grading scheme
Grades will be calculated as follows:
• Assignments: 25% (5 assignments, 5% each)
• Weekly quizzes: 20% (11 quizzes, 2.2̅% each, lowest two grades dropped. See the
Quizzes section below for updated grade breakdown)
• Final exam: 55%
Assignments
There will be five assignments, all weighted equally. Instructions will be posted on UM Learn,
under Course Content/Assignment Instructions. Solutions can be submitted until 11:59pm on
the due date. That said, recall from earlier in the syllabus that I will only reply to forum posts
and emails during business hours, so I will not be available to answer last-minute questions.
Late assignments will be accepted up to 24 hours late, but with a 20% deduction.
Assignments must be completed independently, without any collaboration, discussion, or
consultation with others, other than posting questions to the course forum on UM Learn. You
may have general discussions about course content and class examples with your peers, but
you must complete the assignment questions yourself.
If you believe that there is an error in the grading of an assignment you submit, please send me
an email describing the issue and I will look into making a correction.
Illness and other extenuating circumstances
As per the Self-Declaration for Brief and Temporary Absences Procedure and Policy, medical
documentation is not required for absences of up to 120 hours. A self-declaration form must
be submitted instead.
If you miss an assignment deadline due to illness or other circumstances, please submit this
form either in person or by email as soon as possible, and no later than 48 hours after the
absence. The weight of the missed assignment will be shifted to the final exam.
In the absence of documentation, late assignments will be penalized as described above (20%
deduction).
Additional documentation may be requested from students who claim multiple temporary
absences or absences for more than 120 hours. If you miss significantly more of the course
than is covered by the Temporary Absences Policy, you should consider speaking to an
Academic Advisor about an authorized withdrawal.
Quizzes
There will be a short weekly quiz at the start of class class every Friday, excluding the first and
last full week of the term (so the first quiz is on January 17 and the last is on April 4). The
quizzes are closed-book, so you are not allowed to look at course materials while writing a
quiz.
Originally, each quiz was worth 2%, and the lowest quiz mark would be dropped. Due to
extreme weather on January 17, I changed the policy such that your two lowest quiz marks will
be dropped and not count toward your final grade. This means each quiz is now worth 2.2̅ %.
Final exam
A final exam will be scheduled during the final exam period, April 11-25. If you miss the final
exam due to illness or other circumstances, you must contact an Academic Advisor in the
Faculty of Science to request a deferred final. Please familiarize yourself with the policies here.
A passing grade on the final exam is required in order to pass the class.
Letter grades
Letter grades will be allocated according to the following scale

If possible, contact your instructor for term work such as a quiz, midterm/test,assignment, lab exercise at least 24 hours prior to the due date. If you areunable to do that before the due date, you need to contact your instructor within48 hours of the date of the missed academic work at the latest.In the case of a missed final exam (scheduled in the final examination period), youneed to contact an academic advisor in your faculty of registration within 48 hoursof the date of the exam. It is your home faculty that decides whether or not youare eligible to write a deferred exam.11 Important notes about remote learning during theCOVID-19 pandemicThe information contained in this syllabus represents the current plan under a best-casescenario. Unexpected circumstances or technical problems could make it necessary toalter some parts of this syllabus. If changes are necessary, they will be communicatedon the course website in UMLearn. For this reason, it is your responsibility to regularlycheck the announcements, the calendar and the discussion forum in UMLearn.Students enrolled in this course must ensure they satisfy the following minimum techno-logical requirements:A computing device where one can create and edit documents.A stable internet connection capable of streaming videos and downloading software,and allowing you to take online exams.Access to a web-cam and microphone.12 Determination of letter gradesThe minimum percentage grade required for D, C, C+, B, B+, A, and A+ will be 50, 60,65, 70, 75, 80, and 90%, respectively, plus or minus 5%. Adjustments will be made onlyto ensure grades are assigned fairly. For example, if three students received 67%, 69.95%,and 70.00%, with no others in that range, then the minimum B grade would be adjustedto 69% rather than 70% to avoid unfairly giving different letter grades for 69.95% and70.00%.
