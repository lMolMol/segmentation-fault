Course Descriptions 
U of M Course Description: Background and rationale to view Computer Science in a professional context. 
Examination of professional ethics, intellectual property, and privacy considerations important to Computer 
Scientists. May not be held with the former COMP 3620. This course is restricted to students in a Computer Science 
Major, Honours, or Joint Honours program. Prerequisite: 6 credit hours of COMP courses at the 3000 or 4000 level. 
General Description: This course will 1) facilitate the development of professional skills, including group work skills; 2) 
introduce key critical thinking tools, including socio-technical concepts (STC), and 3) apply these skills, tools, and 
concepts to evaluate the role of the computer scientist related to privacy, professional roles and responsibilities, and 
intellectual property; 4) evaluate and assess current issues related to Computer Science.  
Course Learning Objectives 
At the end of the course this term, students should be able to: 
1. Work confidently and capably within a group. 
2. Apply critical thinking strategies to social issues. 
3. Describe the relationship between technology and society as a social-technical system, where society and 
technology co-shape each other.  
4. Critically evaluate social-technical concepts in Computer Science and related technologies.  
5. Describe Privacy, including its history and key aspects in the computer-science socio-technical system 
(e.g., social media). 
6. Describe Professional Ethics, including its history and key aspects in the computer-science socio-technical 
system (e.g., Bias and Politics in Algorithms).  
7. Describe Intellectual Property, including its history and key aspects in the computer-science socio
technical system (e.g., Artificial Intelligence).  
8. Critically evaluate, describe, and analyze case studies related to course topics.

9. Improve professional development skills, including career decision-making and job searching skills.  
10. List professional organizations related to the field of Computer Science.  
11. Improve awareness of the larger social context—both current and historical—of computer science.  
Traditional Territories Acknowledgment 
Th The University of Manitoba campuses are located on original lands of Anishinaabeg, Ininiwak, Anisininewuk, 
Dakota Oyate and Dene, and on the National Homeland of the Red River Métis.We respect the Treaties that were 
made on these territories, we acknowledge the harms and mistakes of the past, and we dedicate ourselves to move 
forward in partnership with Indigenous communities in a spirit of reconciliation and collaboration. 
In COMP 4620, you have the uncommon opportunity in your journey to completing your degree requirements in 
Computer Science to reflect on your role as a computing professional in society. We will discuss different events, 
factors and topics which will allow you to consider how you can contribute, even a little bit, to improving the tech 
world according to values that matter to you; be they equity, justice, truth, professionalism, collaboration, 
representation, fair recognition, and so on. This includes considering the (often disproportionate) impacts 
technology has on Indigenous communities, often without their participation in developing said technology. 
Equity and Inclusion Commitment 
The UofM has a diverse student and faculty population. In this class, we expect everyone to treat each other with 
respect, no matter their identity or beliefs. All of us are constantly learning about equity and inclusion: if 
something was said to make you uncomfortable (either by your instructor, a teaching/learning assistant, or a 
peer), please talk to your instructor about it and we will do what we can to address the issue. 
In this course, we will discuss and debate topics that people might be passionate about and hold close to their 
heart. Sometimes, in the spirit of learning, we might ask students to defend a viewpoint that they do not 
necessarily agree with. This is meant to promote understanding and a sense of empathy with others. These 
discussions and debates should be conducted respectfully with the goal of sharing perspectives and learning 
together. Ultimately, you will be entering the real world as computing professionals and encounter people with 
many different backgrounds and circumstances, including many who may disagree with your values. 
I wish to use your preferred name and pronouns. If that differs from your record in UMLearn, please let me know 
in person or by email. I encourage you to correct me or your peers if we use the incorrect name and/or pronouns. 
All language spoken or written in the course (e.g., chat, quizzes, assignments, presentations, and the term test) 
should be gender neutral or inclusive of all genders. Students are encouraged to use “they” or “their” as a singular 
pronoun. Language choices should be free from micro aggressions, especially relating to gender, race, age, and 
abilities. In graded materials, as shown in the grading guides, there will be deductions for gendered language 
and non-inclusive assumptions. 
If you have any specific concerns or require assistance due to particular needs, I encourage you to connect with 
Student Accessibility Services (SAS) to facilitate the implementation of accommodations.

LEARNING APPROACHES 
Attendance: Since attendance is so crucial for learning in the class, attendance will be taken each class, in the 
form of software records, group attendance and/or quiz questions. Student are expected to attend each 
scheduled class, and to be active and engaged with the course material and interactive exercises. Grades will be 
deducted for missed classes. Exceptions will be made for illness See Grading and Attendance for more details.  
Group Activities: The first week of the course will offer instruction on group work, group roles, and group 
communication skills. After registration closes, you will be assigned a group to work with for most of the term. 
Groups may be reassigned during the term. 
Interactive Lectures and In-Class Activities: This course is taught as a flipped classroom, meaning you will 
encounter the course material initially by assigned resources done outside of the classroom. Classroom time will 
be used for interactive lectures, in-class exercises, case studies, group discussions, guest speakers, and peer 
editing. Content discussed during in-class activities is quiz-able and testable. 
Case Studies: There are four main topics in the course, each which runs in a two-week block. For each topic, all 
students will read a case study, and a group of your peers will present details of the case resources, and facilitate a 
discussion about the case. Following this discussion, each student who did not present on the case will prepare 
and submit a Written Reflection. 
Term Test: The term test will be held in the last tutorial slot of the term. Students will be tested on all course 
materials for the term, and asked to synthesize connections between course components. Students will also be 
asked to explain, expand, and or describe the content and process of their written reflections. The term test is 
closed book; no notes are permitted.  
Peer Presentation: In groups, students will be required to present on an assigned case study related to the course 
topic. Presenters will lead group activities and discussions. Groups will present to a pod of approximately 12 students 
(including the presenting group).  
Workshops and Guest Speakers: Each course block includes a workshop or guest speaker. These workshops 
and speakers have been chosen to equip computer science students with real-life context for course topics, as well 
as to help students prepare for their future careers.  Attendance is required. Often, although not always, these 
workshops will be scheduled in the tutorial slot (Thursday at 2:30-3:45pm). 
Required Resources: A schedule of required resources indicates which readings/videos students are expected 
to complete BEFORE class. Many resources are available through the world wide web, but some will require access 
through the University of Manitoba Libraries website. Students must also expect to view videos which will require 
purchasing or accessing a paid-platform (e.g., Netflix) and should plan and budget accordingly. Resources are subject 
to change in content and date. 
Three-Stage Quizzes: Quizzes will be used to examine students’ timely completion and comprehension of the 
course resources, interactive lectures, and case-study resources. In a three-stage quiz, the first two stages are done 
individually, and the third stage is done as a group.  See “Graded Course Components”: for quiz details. 
Tutorials: Both sections A01 and A02 are in the Tutorial Section B01, held on Thursdays at 2:30-3:45pm. The tutorial 
slot will be used for quizzes and the term test,  and often for guest speakers. On weeks when the tutorial slot is used, 
the classes proceeding the tutorial will generally be cancelled and used to meet with upcoming presenting groups.  
Written Reflections: Students who did not present on a case study are required to submit a written reflection 
related to the topics in the case study. These reflections ask students to relate the course topics to their own 
personal life experiences, including the peer-led presentations and discussions.  Students will be provided with 
details on how and when they are permitted to use Generative AI for these written reflections. The term test will 
require students to reference their own written reflections. Written Reflections are generally due on the Friday after 
the case study peer presentation.

Syllabus for COMP 4620: Professional Practice in Computer Science (Winter 2025) 
Penner, C.  
GRADED COURSE COMPONENTS 
Three-Stage Quizzes (50%)  
• Quizzes will be used to examine students’ timely completion and comprehension of the course content. 
• QUIZ 1, QUIZ 2, QUIZ 3, and QUIZ 4 will be held at the end of each of the four main sections of the course. 
Each quiz is worth 16% 12.5%, for a total of 64 50%. 
• Three-Stage Quizzes are divided into three sections:  
o Section 1: Essay Question: Each quiz will begin with one essay question. This question will ask 
students to relate course readings and discussions to their own lives, and to other course 
resources.  
▪ Students will have around 25 minutes to write one essay question. 
▪ Students may bring in paper-based notes they have written or typed themselves. No 
computing devices will be permitted. Printouts of the articles are also not allowed. 
▪ This section of the quiz will be worth 10 marks (out of 20). Section 1 questions account 
for 24% of the term grade (6% each quiz).  
o Section 2: Reading Comprehension Questions (Individual):  Students will answer multi-select 
questions and short-answer questions that quiz for reading comprehension on the required 
readings/viewings.  
▪ Students will have around 20 minutes to answer these questions.  
▪ Student may bring in and use notes they have written themselves. 
▪ No external tools (including language translators or Generative AI) are allowed.  
▪ This section of the quiz is worth 9 marks (out of 20).  The second section questions 
account for 24% of the term grade (6% each quiz).  
o Section 3: Reading Comprehension Questions (Group): Question: In groups, students will write a 
quiz very similar to the quiz in Section 2. Students are encouraged to discuss each question with 
their group before answering.  
▪ Groups will have around 25 minutes to discuss and answer this section of the quiz.  
▪ This stage of the quiz is open book; all resources are available. 
▪ The third section accounts for 2% of the term grade (0.5% each quiz). 
• Quizzes will be given during class time. 
• Quizzes may include multiple-choice, multiple true-false questions, short-answer questions, and/or 
written response questions. Other question types may also be present. 
• Quiz questions will be based on all material within a given block, including: 1) interactive lectures, 2) in
class activities, 3) required resources (related to course topics and and/or workshop) 
• Quiz grades will be returned within 5 working days of the quiz date. 
• Missed Quiz Policy: Quizzes are due at the date and time specified on UMLearn. If a quiz is missed due to 
a health condition or family crisis, students should email the instructor at least 24 hours before the quiz or 
as soon as possible; for ONE quiz, at the instructor’s discretion, the quiz’s weight may be distributed to the 
remaining Quizzes.  Additional missed Quizzes will require consultation with an academic advisor. If a quiz 
is missed for any reason other than a health condition or family crisis, there are no make-up Quizzes, and 
the student will receive a grade of 0 on the missed quiz. Quizzes MUST BE WRITTEN IN PERSON.  Writing a 
quiz remotely without permission of the instructor will result in a zero on the quiz.  
• Grade Appeals: Quiz grades may be appealed within 6 days of the date grades were returned using a 
UMLearn form. Appeals using email or outside of the 6-day window will usually not be considered.  
Term Test (20%)  
• The TERM TEST will be held in the last two weeks of classes and will require students to review and 
synthesize material from the entire term. This quiz is worth 20%. Notes are not permitted for the term 
test.  
• A grade of 60% or higher on the Term Test is required to get a grade of C or higher in the course. Students 
with less than 60% on their Term Test will be given a grade of D in the course, unless their overall term 
grade is less than the D grade cut point, in which case they will receive a grade of F.

Penner, C.  
Written Reflections (20%) 
Written Reflections require students to respond to a question described in a Case Study OR to describe and reflect 
on the process of working in a group to prepare a case study. Written Reflections are used to develop and evaluate 
students’ critical thinking on course topics. More details:  
• Each written reflection will be worth 5% of the term grade, for a total of 10% 20%. 
• Students will submit a total of FOUR Written Reflections for grading: 
o THREE Written Reflections will be on Case Studies for which the student observed a different 
group present.  
o ONE Written Reflection on the group process will be due on the same week as the group’s case 
study presentation.  
• Written Reflections will be graded by the Instructor, Grader, and/or TA. 
• Written Reflections will receive a summative grade (e.g., x/5) and formative feedback. Formative feedback 
will generally be in the form of an audio file. All graded feedback will be returned using UMLearn.   
• Written Reflection Specifications, including instructions and grading guidelines, will be posted on 
UMLearn. 
• Written Reflections must be submitted using UMLearn. E-mailed or printed  assignments will not be 
considered.  
• Written Reflections are due by 11:59PM on the due date. Late assignments will be accepted for 48 hours 
without grading penalty. After 48 hours, assignments will generally not be accepted. 
• Grade Appeals: Assignment grades may be appealed within 6 days of the date grades were returned using 
a UMLearn form. Appeals using email or outside of the 6-day window will usually not be considered.  
• Referencing Style: Students should reference materials using the IEEE reference style.  
• A grade of 60% or higher on the Written Reflections (out of 20) is required to get a grade of C or higher 
in the course. Students with less than 60% on their cumulative Written Reflections will be given a grade of 
D in the course, unless their overall term grade is less than the D grade cut point, in which case they will 
receive a grade of F.  
Group Presentation and Discussion (10%) 
In groups, students will be required to prepare and present a live presentation of an assigned Case Study. The goals 
of the presentation are to introduce the case study, introduce peers to helpful resources to learn more about the 
cases, and to invite interaction and discussion about the case.  More details:    
• Each group will plan, produce, and present a live presentation on one assigned case study. 
• For grading purposes, each group must record their live presentation and submit a video of their 
presentation.  
• Following the video/presentation, each group must provide an interactive activity to their group. Your 
instructor will give you ideas for this activity.  
• After the interactive activity, the group will lead a live discussion. Due to privacy concerns, the discussion 
does not need to be recorded.  
• Group presentations will be presented to a “pod” of approximately 12-14 students (including the 
presenting group).  
• Group presentations will be graded by the Instructor, Grader, or TA.  
• A grade of 60% or higher on the Group Presentation is required to get a grade of C or higher in the course. 
Students with less than 60% on their Group Presentation will be given a grade of D in the course, unless 
their overall term grade is less than the D grade cut point, in which case they will receive a grade of F. 
Students who do not participate in the group presentation (as self-reported, reported by group members, 
AND/OR observed by the course instructor or TAs) will NOT receive the same grade as the rest of the group, 
and if their grade is less than 60%, they will receive a grade of D or F in the course. Exceptions will be made 
for students with pressing medical or family emergencies IF the instructor is informed before the 
presentation.

COURSE EXPECTATIONS 
Academic Integrity  
• Each student in this course is expected to abide by the University of Manitoba Academic Integrity 
principles. Always remember to reference the work of others that you have used. Also be advised that 
you are required to complete your assignments independently unless otherwise specified. If you are 
encouraged to work in a team, ensure that your project complies with the academic integrity regulations. 
You must do your own work during exams. Inappropriate  collaborative behavior and violation of other 
Academic Integrity principles, will lead to the serious disciplinary action.  Visit the Academic Calendar, 
Student Advocacy, and Academic Integrity web pages for more information and support.   
• Examples of academic misconduct include: 
o submitting assignments or Quizzes which are not entirely your own work or providing your work 
to another student or students; 
o use of unauthorized material during a test or examination; or 
o sharing any part of your assignment or quiz or test with another person. 
• You will be required to confirm your agreement to an Honesty Declaration before submitting each 
assignment or writing any quiz or test. 
• All students in this course must read and meet the expectations described in the Expectations for 
Individual Work in Computer Science (https://sci.umanitoba.ca/cs/expectations/). Both Written 
Reflections and the first two stages of the Quizzes are considered individual work.  
• Group work and group projects are subject to the rules of academic dishonesty. Academic Integrity rules 
continue to apply to Group work and projects. In this course, Group work includes Stage 3 of all Quizzes, 
and the Group Presentation.  
• The list of suggested minimum penalties assessed by the Faculty of Science for acts of academic 
dishonesty is available on the Faculty of Science webpage: 
https://umanitoba.ca/science/sites/science/files/2023-09/faculty-of-science-academic-misconduct
penalties_1.pdf   
• In the past, students have incorrectly thought they can paraphrase a paragraph someone else wrote as 
long as they reword some of the phrasing. This approach will be flagged for an academic integrity 
investigation. You must word all ideas in your own words. If you use ideas from a source, you must cite 
the source.  
Attendance and Participation 
Attendance in this class is mandatory since each class will involve discussion, group work and/or in-class activities 
that cannot be duplicated outside of class. Class discussion and group work are crucial tools to explore, practice, 
and improve your professional and critical-thinking skills. Attending class in person but not paying attention to the 
course content will also result in a penalty. Arriving late or leaving early will generally be marked as absent. 
Attendance Record not filled in due to lateness, momentary absence, or mismatch in name:  
Students can view the attendance record in UMLearn. Attendance records will be posted shortly after class. Any 
concerns with the attendance record must be submitted using a UMLearn form on the day of the missed class. If 
the attendance record is posted more than three hours after class, students will have 24 hours after the 
attendance record is posted. If a student is late to class and misses the attendance, they must use the Attendance 
Concerns form on the same day as they failed to register their attendance, or they will be marked absent with the 
associated grade penalty. Attendance concerns not submitted during this time window will not be considered.  
Note: The easiest way to avoid attendance concerns is to attend class on time.  
Self-Declared Illness, Travel or Family Emergency: Occasionally students will not be able to attend class due to 
family emergencies, travel difficulties, and illness. Although this is understandable, any absence reflects a loss of 
leaning, which is why all absences result in at least a small grade penalty. For ONE absence, if a student wishes to 
contact the instructor for an additional assignment that relates to the learning objectives of the missed class, they 
may do that, and they will not be marked as absent for that ONE class. The make-up assignment must be 
10 
Syllabus for COMP 4620: Professional Practice in Computer Science (Winter 2025) 
Penner, C.  
submitted within FIVE days of the absence.  This option is not available for students who miss classes due to 
vacations. If students ask for a make-up assignment for an absence due to a Co-op interview, the student must 
include an email from the Co-op office stating the conflict with the course was unavoidable. 
After one missed class, students will NOT be able to request an additional assignment except for in highly unusual 
circumstances, and will receive grade deductions as described under GRADING. Students who are concerned 
about the grade deductions for missing multiple classes should consult with a student advisor to manage their 
absences.  
Note Absence deductions follow the Fibonacci sequence, meaning that the penalties increase quickly after the 
second absence. The attendance penalties are cumulative, to a maximum penalty of 88%.  See GRADES for more 
details. Students unable to attend several classes should note the severe grade penalties, and seek the 
consultation of a Student Advisor. 
Falsifying attendance records is considered academic dishonesty.  
Minimum Technical Requirements 
Students enrolled in the course must ensure they satisfy the following minimum technological requirements: - - - 
A computing device to bring to each lecture that can connect to the U of M Wi-Fi, 
A computing device to create and edit documents, 
Access to an internet connection capable of streaming videos and downloading software. 
Students will frequently need to access course materials during class time.  
UMLearn 
This course relies heavily on UMLearn. Students should familiarize themselves with this interface. See your instructor 
if you have questions about using or accessing UMLearn.  
Inclusive Conduct and Language 
This course requires and assumes support for all students. All language spoken or written in the course (e.g.: chat, 
Quizzes, assignments, presentations) should be gender neutral or inclusive of all genders. Students are encouraged 
to use “they” or “their” as a singular pronoun. Language choices should be free from micro aggressions, especially 
relating to gender, race, age, and abilities. In graded materials, as shown in the grading guides, there will be 
deductions for gendered language and non-inclusive assumptions. 
Zoom Protocols 
If, due to sickness, pedagogical requirements, or room limitations a class must move to remote delivery, we will use 
Zoom. These are the Zoom protocols:  
On Zoom, you are expected to present yourselves as you would in a shared physical space. Students should be fully 
dressed. Use a screen background (if your device allows this) or, if possible, position your background against a wall 
or corner to preserve your home’s privacy. Please mute yourselves unless you are talking. Please help your classmates 
(and instructor) by setting a standard of showing focussed attention for the duration of the class. Turn on cameras 
for group work.  
Class Communication 
You are required to obtain and use your University of Manitoba email account for all communication between 
yourself and the university. All communication must comply with the Electronic Communication with Student 
Policy: 
http://umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/governing_documents/community/electronic_communication_with_stu
 dents_policy.html.  
Ethical and Legal Use of Technology 
It is the general University of Manitoba policy that all technology resources are to be used in a responsible, efficient, 
ethical, and legal manner.

Syllabus for COMP 4620: Professional Practice in Computer Science (Winter 2025) 
Penner, C.  
Instructor Conduct 
I will treat you with respect, and work to facilitate your learning in this course. In particular, I will:  
• Be available for office hours by appointment;  
• Work with the Graders and TAs to get your assignments returned to you in a prompt manner, with the goal 
of returning all assignments within ten working days; 
• Work with the Graders and TAs to offer commentary (usually an audio file) on your assignments, through 
UMLearn;  
• Use evidence-based teaching strategies to facilitate student learning. 
Illness 
If the Instructor, TA, or Graders become ill, all timelines in the syllabus and course website may be revised.  Should 
the instructor be ill, they will work with the CS Department to find a substitute to continue teaching the class in
person.  In the event a suitable instructor cannot be found, the instructor may give the lecture synchronously or 
provide asynchronous content through Zoom or UMLearn for up to 5 days.  An email will be sent to students’ UM 
email and a posting will be made on UM Learn the night before class if this is the case.  
If students become ill, do not come to campus. Instead of a sick note, students are required by the university to 
complete a self-declaration form. See Medical Notes and Other Documentation in Appendix A. If you miss a 
class, and/or quiz due to illness, email your instructor as soon as possible to arrange an alternate method for 
assessment Accommodations will be reasonable but not ideal. Such an arrangement will generally entail moving 
the weight of the quiz and/or assignment to the term test. In rare cases, students may be offered an extension or 
an alternate assignment.  
No more than one assignment and one quiz may have their weight transferred to a different course component; 
remaining missed quizzes and assignments will generally receive a grade of 0. If a student has a self-declared 
absence resulting in missing more than one quiz and one assignment, the absence is no longer deemed temporary, 
and students are advised to speak with an advisor in their faculty/college/school of registration in these instances. 
Recording Class Lectures 
No audio or video recording of lectures or presentations is allowed in any format, openly or surreptitiously, in whole 
or in part without permission from your instructor. Course materials (both paper and digital) are for the participant’s 
private study and research.  
Due to the highly interactive nature of the class time, limited class time will be recorded. This is done to protect 
students’ privacy and encourage class participation. If you miss a class, the best way to find out about the missed 
content is to review the posted notes and complete the assigned readings. 
Case Study presentations should be recorded by the presenting group (only) for marking purposes. 
Using Copyrighted Material 
We will use copyrighted content in this course. I have ensured that the content I use is appropriately acknowledged 
and is copied in accordance with copyright laws and university guidelines. Copyrighted works, including those 
created by me, are made available for private study and research, and must not be distributed in any format without 
permission. Do not upload copyrighted works to a learning management system (such as UMLearn), or any website, 
uncles an exception to the Copyright Act applies or written permission has been confirmed. For more information, 
see the University’s Copyright Office website at http://umanitoba.ca/copyright/ or contact 
um_copyright@umanitoba.ca.  
Using Generative AI 
Unless otherwise specified, students are NOT permitted to use Generative AI tools for writing the first drafts of 
their written reflections, nor for any content submitted in a quiz or test. For certain assignments, the instructor 
will specify and guide the students in using Generative AI to help with the assignments. See assignment guidelines 
and grading guides for more details. .

Health and Safety 
The UM is committed to maintaining a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff. 
Should campus operations change because of health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic or 
other campus-wide emergency, it is possible that this course will move to a fully remote delivery 
format. Should the instructor be required to stay at home for an extended period and an alternate 
instructor not be available, the course may move temporarily to a remote delivery format. 
Mask Wearing 
In a face-to-face environment, our commitment to safety requires students to observe all Covid 
guidelines set by the University (https://umanitoba.ca/coronavirus ) While on campus and in class, you 
must wear masks as stipulated in current University policies, procedures, and guidelines. The University 
highly recommends the use of KN-95 masks; the minimum requirement is a ATSM Level 2 Medical mask. 
Both mask types are available at many locations on campus. Students who fail to comply are subject to 
disciplinary action in accordance with the Student Discipline Bylaw and the Non-Academic Misconduct 
and Concerning Behaviour Procedure. 
Instructors are told to follow the protocols specified in COVID-19 information for staff, faculty, and 
researchers for non-compliance with masking.  Students should not eat or drink during class time. 
Illness 
Remember: STAY HOME IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS OR ARE ILL. If you become ill, we highly recommend 
that you self-isolate; you should notify your instructor by email so you can develop a plan to complete 
the course learning outcomes while you are absent. 
What to do if you become ill while at UM: 
1. Leave the classroom, lab, or workspace immediately. Continue to wear your mask while leaving the 
premises and/or while waiting for transportation. 
2. Perform hand hygiene (soap and water or hand sanitizer) and avoid contact with others and minimize 
contact with the physical environment.  
3. Once at home, complete the MB self-assessment and follow the directions that are provided. 
4. Inform your instructor(s) or, if in residence, the appropriate individual.  The Instructor will discuss 
with you arrangements for extensions, deferrals or make-up assignments as required. 
5. Please remain off-campus and all UM facilities until cleared to return in accordance with self
assessment, testing results, and UM recommended isolation procedures. 
Recommended transportation options (in order):  
1. Drive yourself home. 
2. Pick-up by family or friend – remember to keep your mask on and to distance yourself as 
much as possible, and where possible, open a window to improve ventilation. 
3. Pickup by taxi/Uber: 
a. Remain masked and perform hand hygiene before entering the vehicle. 
b. Avoid touching the inside of the vehicle 
c. Keep your mask on for the duration of the ride 
d. Where possible, open a window to improve ventilation.

Sexual Violence Support and Education  
Sexual violence affects people of all ages, sexual orientations, genders, gender identities, abilities, and 
relationship statuses. At the UM, we are committed to ensuring a respectful work and learning 
environment for all. We want to build a safe and inclusive campus community where survivors of sexual 
violence know they can receive the supports they need to succeed, both academically and personally. 
The Sexual Violence Resource Centre, located at 537 UMSU University Centre (Fort Garry campus) 
provides support, resources, information and referral services for any student, faculty or staff member 
who has been affected by sexual violence. 
Indigenous Students 
Staff, faculty, and Elders are well-equipped to ensure your university experience is as beneficial, 
accessible, and successful as possible. Visit the Indigenous Student Experience website for more 
information on the supports and services available. 
International Students 
The transition to a new country and a new academic system can be both exciting and overwhelming. 
The International Centre (IC) is here to help you settle into life at UM.  Visit the International Students 
website for more information. 
Academic Accommodations 
Students who have, or think they may have, a disability (e.g., mental illness, learning, medical, hearing, 
injury-related, visual) are encouraged to contact Student Accessibility Services to arrange a confidential 
consultation. Instructors are notified by Student Accessibility Services what accommodations their 
registered students require which will help the instructor determine fair, feasible and reasonable 
academic accommodations without compromising academic standards. This takes time and planning, so 
reach out at the start of term. 
SAS students can write their exams and tests in spaces organized by the SAS Exam Centre however they 
must register with the SAS Exam Centre a few weeks in advance.  Please be sure to do so to receive the 
accommodations. 
Medical Notes and Other Documentation 
The Self-Declaration for Brief and Temporary Absences Procedure and Policy is effective as of 
September 1, 2022 and therefore students will not be required to present medical or other 
documentation for absences due to extenuating circumstances of 120 hours or less, however this form 
must be completed and submitted to the instructor in lieu of the documentation.  Please note that 
further documentation may be requested from students who claim multiple temporary absences or 
absences for more than 120 hours. 
Short-Term Academic Accommodations (up to 120 consecutive hours absences) 
As we emerge from the pandemic, the University still has the health and safety of its community at top 
of mind. Since your classes are held in-person, please make sure you follow the  University’s COVID-19 
Health and Safety Protocols. Notably, exercise good hand hygiene, stay home if you are ill and you must 
wear a mask when attending lecture/labs and on campus. 
18 
Syllabus for COMP 4620: Professional Practice in Computer Science (Winter 2025) 
Penner, C.  - - - 
Students who miss a lab or assessment due to an extenuating brief or temporary absence 
should complete a  self-declaration for brief and temporary student absences form and submit 
it to their instructor within 48 hours of the end of the brief absence. The instructor will discuss 
with the student how the missed work can be made up.   
Students absent for over 120 hours as a result of medical, compassionate, University 
scholastic, University athletic or religious event will require official documentation to explain 
the absence.  Students should reach out to instructors early if absences are anticipated. 
Personal vacations and work requirements are not considered acceptable absences.  
Long-Term Academic Accommodations 
Students with long-term academic accommodations are usually registered with Student Accessibility 
Services. The long-term academic accommodations are usually to accommodate long term physical or 
mental illness and accommodations can be in the form of notetaking, interpreting, assistive technology, 
and assessment accommodations.  
Final Exams 
Students who have conflicting scheduled exams should contact their faculty’s academic advisors as soon 
as possible.  Students who miss their exam due to extenuating circumstances can apply for a deferred 
exam.   Please note that the granting of a deferred exam is not necessarily guaranteed. 
Missed Lecture Notes 
Students missing lecture notes as a result of absences are responsible for obtaining the missed content 
on their own accord.  Contact a classmate or the course instructor for their notes but please be aware 
the instructor is not obliged to create notes for students as a result of absences. 
Voluntary Withdrawal (VW) Procedures 
Voluntary withdrawal (VW) is a way for students to leave a class without academic penalty once the 
Registration Revision Period has ended. If you opt to voluntarily withdraw from a course, you will not be 
eligible for a refund and, if applicable, will still be required to pay any outstanding tuition fees for the 
course. On your transcript, the course you have withdrawn from will be listed; however, “VW” will 
appear in lieu of a grade. If you do not drop a course before the VW deadline, you will receive a final

Students have the opportunity to voluntarily withdraw (VW) from this class up to March 22 (in the event 
of date discrepancies, please follow the dates on the Important Dates and Deadlines webpage). By then, 
you will have received feedback to allow you to assess your progress and determine if you are achieving 
the grade you are aiming for in this course. If you are unlikely to be successful in the course, or not 
achieving the grade that you are aiming for, you should consider a VW from the course. You should 
contact your instructor to review your progress in more detail, or you may discuss the VW option with a 
Faculty academic advisor. 
Please note that there are separate deadlines for dropping a course early in a term during the 
Registration Revision Period. Dropping a course means you are removing that course from your 
schedule, will not be charged tuition fees for that course, and the course will not appear on your 
transcript.  
The Registrar’s Office website, Withdraw from a Course, includes more information on the different 
ways in which you can withdraw from a course and important dates and deadlines to do so.

Professional Conduct

Academic Integrity 
Academic integrity is taking responsibility for and being honest with your work and respecting the work 
of others. Since you are a member of the university community, we want you to learn what that 
responsibility and honesty entails and how we respect the work of others. 
The Faculty of Science continues to uphold high standards of academic integrity.  We know that you, our 
students, support us in this and we count on every one of you to do your part.  We expect all students 
to strictly adhere to instructions from their professors regarding what resources can and cannot be used 
for assessments, to follow other rules the professors wish to set, and to adhere to the academic conduct 
standards of the University and Faculty.  
To aid professors in assuring that all forms of assessments have been administered fairly, the University 
will be electronically monitoring all tests, tests, and examinations, included, but not limited to 
overseeing chatrooms, relevant predatory websites and, in so doing, we will analyze scholastic evidence 
of individual exams. 
Students who transgress academic integrity rules will be investigated and disciplined (if justified) 
according to the Student Discipline By-Law and Student Academic Misconduct Procedure. 
The list of suggested minimum penalties assessed by the Faculty of Science for acts of academic 
dishonesty is available on the Faculty of Science website.
